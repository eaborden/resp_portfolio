Portfolio Page - portfolio.html - https://eaborden.github.io/resp_portfolio/portfolio.html
Contact page - contact.html - https://eaborden.github.io/resp_portfolio/contact.html

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Use the bootstrap CSS framework to create mobile responsive portfolio.  All of the sites must meet the following criteria:

1. Utilize a navbar
2. A reponsive layout
3. Responsive images

**REQUIREMENTS**

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

**SHORTCOMINGS**

The project was delivered late by 4 hours.  This could have been avoided by committing the code to the repository more frequesntly.  I had a page stop working at it took more time than expected to resolve the issue.  This could have been resolved sooner if I had more history in my repository.
